# shell

This is a shell command emulator. Basically, you can run this program, give it any command line instructions, and the program will execute the commands using system calls. It can execute pipes, command delimiters, background execution, and input and output redirection. NOTE: I did not make the parser but I made everything else.

## Usage

:$ make

:$ ./myShell

    From here you can give it any command, just type exit to close the program
:$ ./sne Hello World!

    You can type this in the shell as a test
